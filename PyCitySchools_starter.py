# ## School Summary

# * Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
#   * School Name
#   * School Type
#   * Total Students
#   * Total School Budget
#   * Per Student Budget
#   * Average Math Score
#   * Average Reading Score
#   * % Passing Math
#   * % Passing Reading
#   * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

# ## Math Scores by Grade

# * Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
# 
#   * Create a pandas series for each grade. Hint: use a conditional statement.
#   
#   * Group each series by school

# * Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:
#   * Average Math Score
#   * Average Reading Score
#   * % Passing Math
#   * % Passing Reading
#   * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)
